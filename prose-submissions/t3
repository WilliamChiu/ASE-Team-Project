Part 2 - Acceptance Testing User Stories:
1) FRESHMEN: As a freshman, I want to view the Columbia campus and spatially understand its layout so that I will be less disoriented when I eventually come to campus for the first time.
My conditions of satisfaction are: Common cases:
a) The chat rooms must be linked to different locations on Columbia campus, and link to one another in a way consistent with campus’s layout.
One special case is:
a) If the user tries to access a location, or a chatroom associated with a
location which we do not support, we will reject any such request.
Valid test case:
We went to the main site page, and were presented with a login page. We clicked
the login button, and logged in with a columbia email account. After logging in, we were presented with a welcome page with a picture in front of Butler library. We clicked on the links to chat rooms "john jay" and "lerner" which redirected us to different chatrooms that had corresponding pictures of Columbia in the background. In the "lerner" chat room, we entered some text into the chat box, and it showed up on screen for the other users.
Invalid test case:
For this case, we went to the website and logged in with a Columbia email as
shown in the valid test case. However, after logging in, we attempted to enter a non-existent room with an API request that had the name of a non-existent chatroom. We were directed to an error message instead.
 
 2) INCOMING STUDENT: As an incoming student (freshmen/transfer student), I want to be able to communicate with other new students so that I can build an auxiliary social network before physically meeting them.
My conditions of satisfaction are:
Common cases:
a) There must be a communication functionality in the form of chat that
allows me to send messages to other people on the platform Special cases:
a) If a user tries to private message another user which they are not friends with, their message will result in an error, and will be rejected (the message won’t be sent).
Valid test case:
We logged into the application with multiple accounts using Columbia emails.
When we were presented with the landing page, we entered text into the chat window. We confirmed that this text was available to the other users who were logged into the website.
Invalid test case:
We logged into the application like before, with multiple accounts. On one account,
at the landing page, we entered a string into the chatbox that exceeded 1000 characters in length. We were presented with an error message that stated the chat message was too long, and it did not get posted in the chatroom.
3) CLUB MEMBERS: As a member of an in person club on campus, I want a virtual meeting place where I can meet up with other members so that we can continue to get to know each other and have a fun way to socialize, even though we are not meeting on campus.
My conditions of satisfaction are:
Common cases:
a) Users should be able to move around the room so that people can know who is talking.
Special cases:
a) If a user tries to move to an invalid spot in a chat room, via an API request, their move will be invalidated.
Valid test case:
We logged into the application using a Columbia Email. At the landing page, we
clicked around on the landing page and our avatar moved to the location we clicked.

Invalid test case:
We logged into the application using a Columbia Email. We sent an API request to
move the account's lion avatar to an invalid spot on the grid (outside of [0,0] to [100,100]). We were presented with an error message and our avatar was not moved.
